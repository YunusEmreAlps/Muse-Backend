# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The **Muse** team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

If you discover a security vulnerability in **Muse**, please disclose it via GitLab security issues. The **Muse** maintainers will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report you will be kept informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement.

Report security bugs in third-party dependencies to the person or team maintaining the module.
